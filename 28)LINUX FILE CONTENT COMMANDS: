1. Cat
This is the simplest and perhaps the most popular command to view a file in Linux.

2. nl
The nl command is almost like the cat command. The only difference is that it prepends line numbers while displaying the text in the terminal.

3. Less
Less command views the file one page at a time. The best thing is that you exit less (by pressing q), there are no lines displayed on the screen.
Your terminal remains clean and pristine.

4. Head
Head command is another way of viewing text file but with a slight difference. The head command displays the first 10 lines of a text file by default.

5. Tail
Tail command in Linux is similar and yet opposite to the head command. While head command displays file from the beginning, the tail command displays file from the end.
By default, tail command displays the last 10 lines of a file.

Bonus: Strings command::
Okay! I promised to show only the commands for viewing text files. And this one deals with both text and binary files.
The Strings command displays the readable text from a binary file.
No, it doesnâ€™t convert binary files into text files. If the binary file consists of actual readable text, the strings command displays those text on your screen.
You can use the file command to find the type of a file in Linux.
